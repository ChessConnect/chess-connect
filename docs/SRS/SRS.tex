\section{Units, Terms, Acronyms, and Abbreviations}

\subsection{Table of Units}
Throughout this document SI (Syst\`{e}me International d'Unit\'{e}s) is employed
as the unit system.  In addition to the basic units, several derived units are
used as described below.  For each unit, the symbol is given followed by a
description of the unit and the SI name.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \noindent \begin{tabular}{l l l} 
    \toprule		
    \textbf{symbol} & \textbf{unit} & \textbf{SI}\\
    \midrule 
    \si{\volt} & electric potential & volt\\
    \si{\ampere} & current	& ampere\\
    \si{\ohm} & resistance	& ohm\\
    \si{\second} & time & second\\
    \si{\celsius} & temperature & centigrade\\
    \si{\joule} & energy & joule\\
    \si{\watt} & power & watt (W = \si{\joule\per\second})\\

\subsection{Document Purpose}
\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader}
{The document is written with the purpose of guiding development for the \progname{} team. The intended readers of this document 
are the developers of \progname{}, Dr.~Spencer Smith, and Nicholas Annable, the teaching assistant assigned to this project. The 
document is thus written for an audience that is well-versed in formal specification at a university level. This includes models, 
diagrams, and mathematical notation. Readers should also have a university-level understanding of electrical circuit knowledge.}

\section{Scope}
{The system is called \progname{}, and will include a software application and physical hardware device. The hardware will take the 
form of a chess set, and will collect and relay move and piece data. The device will convey the best moves for the specific board 
position, and will convey legal moves for specific pieces.The device will be connected to the software application, relaying and 
receiving relevant data. The software application will model and track the physical device, and will broadcast the data in an accessible 
format. The application will be constrained to a 2-dimensional model of the hardware device, showing a top-down view of the game.}

\bigskip
\noindent{\textbf{In-scope} items for the system include the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Modeling and tracking a chess game played using the \progname{} hardware
    \item Displaying and broadcasting the game state on the \progname{} software application
    \item Giving users an option to choose between beginner mode, engine mode, and normal mode
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Beginner mode will display legal moves for individual pieces when a chess piece is picked up, and will warn the players when an illegal move is made
        \item Engine mode will display the best moves as determined by a chess engine for the position
        \item Normal mode will disable the engine and beginner mode features. This is intended for regular play between experienced players
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}}

\bigskip

\noindent{The following items are deemed to be \textbf{out of scope}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item FIDE (International Chess Federation) standards for tournament appropriate chess equipment
    \item Tracking and support for alternate chess variants such as Chess960, Atomic Chess, King of the Hill. More information found here: \cite{ListOfChessVariants2022}.
    \item Proper tracking of alternate starting positions like puzzles
    \item Proper tracking of illegal moves and rule violations when warnings are ignored
\end{enumerate}}
