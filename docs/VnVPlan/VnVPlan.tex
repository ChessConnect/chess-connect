%You, your classmates and the course instructor.  Maybe your supervisor.
%You shoud do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
%for the project.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}
SRS verification is performed by the teammates throughout the design and testing 
process. They will reference requirements and consider the results throughout design. 
Teammates will periodically verify this completeness throughout the design process. 
The verification and validation report will reference an associated requirement for 
each test. This allows for tracking of individual requirement fullfilment 
throughout the process. 
%List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may just
%be ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may have
%something more rigorous/systematic in mind..

%Remember you have an SRS checklist

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}
\textbf{Hardware Design Verification} begins with LTSpice and Multisim design software
packages. The designed circuits are simulated in the software and tested accordingly.
Testingincludes simulating inputs and verifying that expected outputs are returned. 
Edge cases are simulated to verify safety and failure conditions of the circuits. 
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Software Design Verification} utilizes the compiler to verify code correctness. 
Arduino intergrated development environments contain the tools to compile and check for 
errors. Code walkthroughs are performed by collaborators that did not write the program. 
This includes detailed inspection and a report describing the function of the code 
based on their perspective. This tests the readability and functionality of 
the code. 
%Plans for design verification}
%The review will include reviews by your classmates}
%Remember you have MG and MIS checklists}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

The Verification and Validation Plan verification will include reviewing the \href{file:../Checklists/VnV-Checklist.pdf}{Verification and Validation Plan checklist} and adjusting this document accordingly. The verification will also include considering feedback from issues created by another team, as well as from the TA assigned to this project. Comments and improvements will be implemented after completing revision 0 of this document.
%The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be verified.

%The review will include reviews by your classmates

%Create a checklists?

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}
\textbf{Hardware Implementation Verification} begins with individual components. First 
the power supply is tested with a voltemeter for accuracy and precision. Then, 
the microcontroller is powered on and each individual I/O is tested for correctness. 
Inputs will be powered via the power supply and readings are verified for correctness 
using custom testing software installed on the controller. Outputs are verified using 
the voltemeter to measure correctness relative to the controller value. Finally, 
sensors and circuits are tested using the IO of the microcontroller. This allows
for accurate and detailed inspection of the components and verifies their correctness. 
\newline 
\newline 
\textbf{Software Implementation Verification} requires the hardware to be tested and 
assembled before beginning. The software is downloaded to the controller and the inputs 
and outputs are configured one-by-one. Functionality of code is tested with unit tests
from section 5.1 with the appropriate hardware. Once each section is unit tested, the
sub-systems can begin to combine to test completness of full systems and their functionality.

%You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
%testing plan.
%In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static verification of
%the implementation.  Potential techniques include code walkthroughs, code
%inspection, static analyzers, etc.

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

Automated testing will be carried out for the software involved with this project. Unit tests will be created to test the functionality fo each function created for the program. A minimum of one "successful" test will be written to describe the intended program execution, and one or more "unsuccessful" tests will be written to test the robustness of the program. This will ensure complete code coverage for the software. There are 3 main classes of tests that will be run involving the different aspects \progname{}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Linting:} Performed on Python and Javascript code. This will be integrated into VS Code to assist in local development; this will be run as a Github Workflow as a non-blocking check before building the software.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item \href{https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint}{ESLint} to be used for Javascript
      \item \href{https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.flake8}{Flake8} to be used for Python
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Unit Tests:} Detailed in \hyperref[UnitTests]{Section \ref*{UnitTests}}, unit tests will be performed for Python, Javascript and C code.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \href{https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library}{React Testing Library} will be used for Javascript unit tests.
      \item \href{https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/}{PyTest} will be used for Python unit tests.
      \item \href{https://aceunit.sourceforge.net/}{AceUnit} will be used for C unit tests.
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Dynamic Analysis Tool:} in addition to creating unit tests for the C code, memory leaks and access errors will be caught using \href{https://valgrind.org/}{ValGrind}.
  
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Debuggers:} Dynamic analysis will also be performed on the code through debuggers to verify the system and unit tests, as well as normal operation. These tools will be used extensively to bring all unit tests to a successful state, and to determine the root cause of any inconsistent behaviour from the hardware.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The broswer's (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) built in debugger will be used for stepping through the Javascript code on the web application.
    \item \href{https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html}{pdb} will be used for Python debugging.
    \item \href{https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/zero/debugging-with-zero}{Arduino Zero Built-in Debugger Interface} will be used for debugging embedded C code.
  \end{itemize}


%What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics. Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for Python.

%If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to that document.

%The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the implementation.



\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

Software will be validated by reviewing the requirements in the \href{file:../SRS/SRS.pdf}{Software Requirement Specifications} document and ensuring the software matches the expected performance and behaviour. The chess engine software integration will be validated by comparing it alongside an established online chess engine running the same Stockfish build as is selected for \progname{}, and comparing the recommended moves. One webside that may be used is \href{https://www.365chess.com/analysis_board.php}{365Chess.com}.
\newline
\newline
Feedback from members of the team that are assigned to another area of the system will be called to verify the software is performing adequately. For example, a member working on the web app may come to test the hardware to ensure the sequences and behaviour is intuitive and user friendly. Feedback and comments from the professor and TA assigned to this project will also be considered when making ajustments to the software.
\newline
\newline
Unit tests will be created that capture both normal-use and failure modes to validate the software as well. Unit tests will be integrated in a Github workflow to ensure that changes are never made to the software that conflict with other areas of the code. Failing unit tests will be used as direction to change parts of the software back to a valid state of operation.

%If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that here.

%You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based inspection?

%This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.

        Type: Structural, Static, Manual
                            
        Initial State: Users have not seen the product before, and the product is in its initial game state.
                            
        Input/Condition: Users are asked to identify the product.
                            
        Output/Result: The majority of users are able to successfully identify the product as a chess set without any outside assistance within 10 seconds.
                            
        How test will be performed: A test group of people who do not play chess regularly are asked to identify the product immediately after it is revealed to them.
            The time it takes for them to identify the product will be recorded. The subjects must identify the product as a chess set within 10 seconds or less, averaged
            over the number of people in the test group.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Usability and Humanity}
\paragraph{Learnability}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{NFT2}

        Type: Structural, Static, Manual
                            
        Initial State: Product is in normal mode, a game has started, and the users have not interacted with the product before. 
                            
        Input/Condition: Users are asked to use the product and move one specified piece from one square to another specified square on the board.
                            
        Output/Result: The majority of users understand which piece they moved and to where, and are able to identify that the web application 
            has reflected their move in the virtual model within 30 seconds of studying the visual representation of the board state.
                            
        How test will be performed: A test group of people who do not play chess regularly are asked to move pieces on the chessboard. They are 
            then asked to identify the move they just made as reflected in the web application model. The subjects must identify that the piece they
            moved on the board has also been moved on the web application's virtual model within 30 seconds or less, averaged over the number of people
            in the test group.
                        
    \item{NFT3}

        Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Static etc.
                            
        Initial State: The product shall be representing the state of the game that is in progress. The pieces shall be in a legal position according to 
            the rules of chess. The pieces shall not all be in their starting positions, and there is at least one of each type of piece 
            (pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, king) on the board.
                            
        Input: Users are asked to identify the names of different pieces and squares based on their visual appearance in both the 
            physical product and the web application.
                            
        Output: The majority of users are able to identify the names of pieces and squares based on their likeliness to historically used symbols and shapes.
                            
        How test will be performed: A test group of people who have played chess in the past or play chess regularly are asked to identify each of the pieces 
            and squares from an in-progress game of chess using the system. The justification for this is to avoid piece identification based on their starting 
            positions. The majority of the group should be able to visually identify every piece and square within 2 minutes of seeing the position for the first time.

        Output/Result: The system stores the game state in local memory until power is restored.
                            
        How test will be performed: A game of chess is being played when the power is switched off. The power is then restored after 5 or more seconds. A single
            move is made and the state of the game is tested against the web application. The state of the game should be unchanged from before power was lost.

% \section{Unit Test Description}

% \wss{Reference your MIS and explain your overall philosophy for test case
%   selection.}  
% \wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS has
%   been completed.}

% \subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

% \wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
%   developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
%   verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
%   have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
%   explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

% \subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

% \wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
%   appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
%   technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

% \subsubsection{Module 1}

% \wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
%   References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
%   perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
%   tests were selected.}

% \subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

% \wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
%   performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
%   nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

% \wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
%   mentioned functional tests.}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}
