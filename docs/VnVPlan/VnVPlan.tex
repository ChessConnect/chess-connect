%You, your classmates and the course instructor.  Maybe your supervisor.
%You shoud do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
%for the project.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}
SRS verification is performed by the teammates throughout the design and testing 
process. They will reference requirements and consider the results throughout design. 
Teammates will periodically verify this completeness throughout the design process. 
The verification and validation report will reference an associated requirement for 
each test. This allows for tracking of individual requirement fullfilment 
throughout the process. 
%List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may just
%be ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may have
%something more rigorous/systematic in mind..

%Remember you have an SRS checklist

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}
\textbf{Hardware Design Verification} begins with LTSpice and Multisim design software
packages. The designed circuits are simulated in the software and tested accordingly.
Testingincludes simulating inputs and verifying that expected outputs are returned. 
Edge cases are simulated to verify safety and failure conditions of the circuits. 
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Software Design Verification} utilizes the compiler to verify code correctness. 
Arduino intergrated development environments contain the tools to compile and check for 
errors. Code walkthroughs are performed by collaborators that did not write the program. 
This includes detailed inspection and a report describing the function of the code 
based on their perspective. This tests the readability and functionality of 
the code. 
%Plans for design verification}
%The review will include reviews by your classmates}
%Remember you have MG and MIS checklists}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}
\textbf{Hardware Implementation Verification} begins with individual components. First 
the power supply is tested with a voltemeter for accuracy and precision. Then, 
the microcontroller is powered on and each individual I/O is tested for correctness. 
Inputs will be powered via the power supply and readings are verified for correctness 
using custom testing software installed on the controller. Outputs are verified using 
the voltemeter to measure correctness relative to the controller value. Finally, 
sensors and circuits are tested using the IO of the microcontroller. This allows
for accurate and detailed inspection of the components and verifies their correctness. 
\newline 
\newline 
\textbf{Software Implementation Verification} requires the hardware to be tested and 
assembled before beginning. The software is downloaded to the controller and the inputs 
and outputs are configured one-by-one. Functionality of code is tested with unit tests
from section 5.1 with the appropriate hardware. Once each section is unit tested, the
sub-systems can begin to combine to test completness of full systems and their functionality.

%You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
%testing plan.
%In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static verification of
%the implementation.  Potential techniques include code walkthroughs, code
%inspection, static analyzers, etc.

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

        How test will be performed: A test group of people who have played chess in the past or play chess regularly are asked to play a full game of chess. 
            Their moves and the web application response will be recorded and compared against each other. The number of discrepancies between the physical 
            moves and moves made on the web application will be recorded. The number of discrepancies averaged over the entire test group must be less than 
            or equal to 1.

        Type: Structural, Static, Manual
                            
        Initial State: The product is in the initial game state and is in engine mode.
                            
        Input/Condition: Moves are made until the game state is in one of a set of predetermined computationally complicated chess positions.
                            
        Output/Result: The level of memory used by the web application shall be no more than 1 Gigabyte (GB) at any measured point.
                            
        How test will be performed: Moves will be made until the game state is in one of a set of predetermined computationally complicated chess positions. 
            The engine will then be using the maximum amount of memory to compute the best possible moves for the position. The amount of memory used will be 
            measured and recorded using windows task manager. The amount of memory must never exceed 1 GB at any measured point.

        Type: Structural, Static, Manual
                            
        Initial State: The product is in normal mode and a chess game is in progress on the system.
                            
        Input/Condition: The Bluetooth connection is severed between the web application and the product.
                            
        Output/Result: The web application indicates that the Bluetooth connection has been lost.
                            
        How test will be performed: A game of chess is being played when the Bluetooth option is switched off on the server, severing the connection.
            The web application must display an alert that the Bluetooth connection has been lost.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item{NFT12}

        Type: Structural, Static, Manual
                            
        Initial State: The product is in normal mode and a chess game is in progress on the system.
                            
        Input/Condition: The power connection to the system is severed.
                            
        Output/Result: The system stores the game state in local memory until power is restored.
                            
        How test will be performed: A game of chess is being played when the power is switched off. The power is then restored after 5 or more seconds. A single
            move is made and the state of the game is tested against the web application. The state of the game should be unchanged from before power was lost.

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{Reference your MIS and explain your overall philosophy for test case
  selection.}  
\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS has
  been completed.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}




\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}
