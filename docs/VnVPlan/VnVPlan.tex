This document ... \wss{provide an introductory blurb and roadmap of the
  Verification and Validation plan}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (MG, MIS, etc).  You can include these even
  before they are written, since by the time the project is done, they will be
  written.}

\citet{SRS}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.   You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{You, your classmates and the course instructor.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You shoud do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may just
  be ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may have
  something more rigorous/systematic in mind..}

\wss{Remember you have an SRS checklist}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Remember you have MG and MIS checklists}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static verification of
  the implementation.  Potential techniques include code walkthroughs, code
  inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\section{System Test Description}
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.}

\subsubsection{Look and Feel}
\paragraph{Style}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{NFT1}

        Type: Structural, Static, Manual
                            
        Initial State: Users have not seen the product before, and the product is in its initial game state.
                            
        Input/Condition: Users are asked to identify the product.
                            
        Output/Result: The majority of users are able to successfully identify the product as a chess set without any outside assistance within 10 seconds.
                            
        How test will be performed: A test group of people who do not play chess regularly are asked to identify the product immediately after it is revealed to them.
            The time it takes for them to identify the product will be recorded. The subjects must identify the product as a chess set within 10 seconds or less, averaged
            over the number of people in the test group.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Usability and Humanity}
\paragraph{Learnability}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{NFT2}

        Type: Structural, Static, Manual
                            
        Initial State: Product is in normal mode, a game has started, and the users have not interacted with the product before. 
                            
        Input/Condition: Users are asked to use the product and move one specified piece from one square to another specified square on the board.
                            
        Output/Result: The majority of users understand which piece they moved and to where, and are able to identify that the web application 
            has reflected their move in the virtual model within 30 seconds of studying the visual representation of the board state.
                            
        How test will be performed: A test group of people who do not play chess regularly are asked to move pieces on the chessboard. They are 
            then asked to identify the move they just made as reflected in the web application model. The subjects must identify that the piece they
            moved on the board has also been moved on the web application's virtual model within 30 seconds or less, averaged over the number of people
            in the test group.
                        
    \item{NFT3}

        Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Static etc.
                            
        Initial State: The product shall be representing the state of the game that is in progress. The pieces shall be in a legal position according to 
            the rules of chess. The pieces shall not all be in their starting positions, and there is at least one of each type of piece 
            (pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, king) on the board.
                            
        Input: Users are asked to identify the names of different pieces and squares based on their visual appearance in both the 
            physical product and the web application.
                            
        Output: The majority of users are able to identify the names of pieces and squares based on their likeliness to historically used symbols and shapes.
                            
        How test will be performed: A test group of people who have played chess in the past or play chess regularly are asked to identify each of the pieces 
            and squares from an in-progress game of chess using the system. The justification for this is to avoid piece identification based on their starting 
            positions. The majority of the group should be able to visually identify every piece and square within 2 minutes of seeing the position for the first time.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Performance}
\paragraph{Speed and Latency}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{NFT4}

        Type: Structural, Static, Manual
                            
        Initial State: The product is in normal mode, and a game has started.
                            
        Input/Condition: Users are asked to pick up a piece and suspend it midair without placing it down.
                            
        Output/Result: The board shall visually indicate where the held piece is able to move according to the rules of chess within a specific time frame.
                            
        How test will be performed: A test group of people who have played chess in the past or play chess regularly are asked to pick up a specific piece and 
            hold it. The system will give visual indicators of where the held piece is able to move according to the rules of chess. The time between when 
            they pick up the piece and when the visual response occurs is measured and recorded. This process is repeated 5 times per user. The individual and average
            times are recorded. The response times are then averaged over the entire test group. The average response time of the entire test group must be less than 
            AVERAGE\_HELP\_TIME 0.5s.
                        
    \item{NFT5}

        Type: Structural, Static, Manual
                            
        Initial State: The results of the previous test, NFT4, have been measured and recorded.
                            
        Input/Condition: The results of NFT4.
                            
        Output/Result: The maximum recorded time of any individual response is within a specific time frame.
                            
        How test will be performed: The times measured in the previous test, NFT4, will be inspected. The maximum recorded individual time must be less than 
            MAXIMUM\_HELP\_TIME 2s.

    \item{NFT6}

        Type: Structural, Static, Manual
                            
        Initial State: The product is in normal mode, and a game has started.
                            
        Input/Condition: Users are asked to pick up a piece and legally move it to a square according to the rules of chess.
                            
        Output/Result: The web application shall reflect their move in the virtual model within a specific time frame.
                            
        How test will be performed: A test group of people who have played chess in the past or play chess regularly are asked to pick up a specific piece and 
            legally move it to another square according to the rules of chess. The web application will reflect their move in the virtual model. The time between 
            when they place down the piece and when the web application response occurs is measured and recorded. This process is repeated 5 times per user. The 
            individual and average times are recorded. The response times are then averaged over the entire test group. The average response time of the entire
            test group must be less than AVERAGE\_RESPONSE\_TIME 5s.

    \item{NFT7}

        Type: Structural, Static, Manual
                                
        Initial State: The results of the previous test, NFT6, have been measured and recorded.
                            
        Input/Condition: The results of NFT6.
                            
        Output/Result: The maximum recorded time of any individual response is within a specific time frame.
                            
        How test will be performed: The times measured in the previous test, NFT6, will be inspected. The maximum recorded individual time must be less than 
            MAXIMUM\_RESPONSE\_TIME 10s.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Health and Safety}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{NFT8}

        Type: Structural, Static, Manual
                            
        Initial State: The product is in normal mode, and a game has started.
                            
        Input/Condition: 10 wires are chosen as a sample.
                            
        Output/Result: The maximum power on any single wire shall be within the required limit.
                            
        How test will be performed: A sample of 10 wires are chosen arbitrarily from across the entire system. The voltage and amperage of 
            each wire in the sample are measured and recorded. The power shall then be calculated and recorded. The maximum power of any wire
            in the sample must not exceed the safe limits determined in the Canadian Electrical Code \cite{CanadianElectricalCode2021}.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Precision and Accuracy}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{NFT9}

        Type: Structural, Static, Manual
                            
        Initial State: The product is in the initial game state.
                            
        Input/Condition: Users are instructed to play a full game of chess using the \progname{} system.
                            
        Output/Result: The web application will properly reflect the moves made on the physical product the majority of the time.
                            
        How test will be performed: A test group of people who have played chess in the past or play chess regularly are asked to play a full game of chess. 
            Their moves and the web application response will be recorded and compared against each other. The number of discrepancies between the physical 
            moves and moves made on the web application will be recorded. The number of discrepancies averaged over the entire test group must be less than 
            or equal to 1.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Reliability and Availability}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{NFT10}

        Type: Structural, Static, Manual
                            
        Initial State: 
                            
        Input/Condition: Users are instructed to play a full game of chess using the \progname{} system.
                            
        Output/Result: The web application will properly reflect the moves made on the physical product the majority of the time.
                            
        How test will be performed: A test group of people who have played chess in the past or play chess regularly are asked to play a full game of chess. 
            Their moves and the web application response will be recorded and compared against each other. The number of discrepancies between the physical 
            moves and moves made on the web application will be recorded. The number of discrepancies averaged over the entire test group must be less than

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{Reference your MIS and explain your overall philosophy for test case
  selection.}  
\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS has
  been completed.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}
